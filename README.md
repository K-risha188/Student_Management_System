# Student_Management_System
A Student Management System developed using Python allows for efficient management of students, teachers, and courses. It generates random IDs for each student and teacher, storing essential details like their name, email, phone number, and address. The system also enables the addition of courses, with each course having a name and a brief description. It displays the data in a tabular format using the tabulate module, making it easy to view and organize. Additionally, the system allows users to display details of a single student, teacher, or course by searching with their respective IDs. This system can be expanded with features like searching and updating records for enhanced functionality.
